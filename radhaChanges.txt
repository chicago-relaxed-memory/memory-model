1. Def 2.1 
     * Add coherence requirement.  
         Any conflicting actions on a location are ordered
     * If a precondition phi depends on x, it is treated
         as a read of x for above purposes

2. Prefixing

   Def 2.10
          Drop 3b,4b,4c,5a

   Def: A filter x=v  |> P ensures that the events (phi | e) are such that  phi ==> phi[x/v] 

   Def: [r=x; C] = cup_v cup_phi ((phi|  R x v ) ==> (x=v |> [C](x/r)) 
   Def: [x=M; C] as before

3. Parallel: 
        (force the two sides to have no unresolved precond
         so parallels cannot share registers with each other
         parallel child is a separate sequential context
         all assumptions validated for top level parallel)
   
   Using || for current sem definition
   [| C1 || C2 |] = true |> [| C1 |] || true |> [| C2 |]

4. Sequential composition.

      Drop subs on reads
      Drop 5a
