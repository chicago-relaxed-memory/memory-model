\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


We present a model with the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item precisely models dependency
\item is compositional
\item satisfies JMM test cases and other examples
\item supports a program logic and no-TAR
\item DRF programs have SC semantics
\item Compilation result (compile to C++, or LLVM, or hardware models) without fences
\item Soundness of optimizations (list from LDRF paper + those from promising semantics)
\end{itemize}
