We eliminated the old 7.1-2 discussing Hoare logic.  Unlike the other results
in the paper, this result was both fragile and narrow.  We decided make room
to explain the results that are more robust and broadly applicable.

We dramatically rewrote and reorganized the paper in response to your
feedback.  Only the sections on "Thin air" and "ARMv" are substantially the
same.  This is how the sections have moved:

    OLD   NEW
     2    2-4    Model + Properties + Refinements
     3     5     Extensions
     4     6     Thin air
     5     7     ARMv8
     6     8     LDRF
    7.3   3.2    Valid/Invalid rewrites
     8     9     Related
     9     10    Limitations
 
We refactored section the old section 2 into three sections
  2:   a simple semantics
  3.1: litmus tests
  3.2: rewrites that hold for the simple semantics
  4:   refinements to handle read/write elimination and case analysis

Other changes:

+ section 1:   
   Added a starter memory model example:  (*) and (\dagger)

+ section 2:
   Reorganized the presentation of prefixing

+ section 3.1:
   corrected the discussion of JMM litmus tests

   added TC16

   added more discussion of coherence

   add discussion of MCA1/MAC2

   moved discussion of Sevcik thesis to the end of section 4
+ section 3.2:
   strengthened RL and CSE to get rid of read saturation

   split CA to clarify which direction works in the simple model

+ section 4:
   cleanup of write prefixing (more precise than previous use of ||)

   changed the semantics so that read elimination is now valid without appeal to "read saturation"

   fixed bug in read-prefixing (See last paragraph of "Case Analysis")

   strengthened SF to get rid of read saturation

   added RE and RI

+ section 5:
   cleanup address calculation

+ section 6:
   moved RFUB here, moved old example to intro

+ section 7:
   added one example at beginning to clarify which version of ARMv8 we are targeting

+ section 8:
   added precise definition and detail in the proof so as to be self contained

   added two new examples comparing to Dolan, et al: one for past races and one for future races

+ section 9:
   added discussion of [Paviotti et al. 2020]

+ section 10:
   removed argumentative bits

   added a paragraph discussing java final field semantics w.r.t. read-read dependencies
