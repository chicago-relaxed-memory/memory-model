A. no PO out of W.
B. PO out of R only if there is a data or control dependency 
C. Reordering of independent statements

1. Sequentialization by augmentation.
2. Red load, Store Forwarding, Dead Store: reason with semantics
3. Common subexp, Dead store, Loop invariant, Constant propagation
               : exactly as LDRF because of reordering of ind statements 
			   
But also:
  [r1 = a; b = c; a = r1]
===⇒ [r1 = a; a = r1; b = c]
===⇒ [r1 = a; b = c]
