\section{Compiling to hardware}

\citet{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/PodkopaevLV19} define the \emph{Intermediate
  Memory Model (IMM)} and provide efficient implementations of the IMM into
several processor architectures, including TSO, ARMv8 and Power.

In this section, we show that any execution allowed by the IMM is also
allowed by our semantics.

Our language is a sublanguage of the IMM
