\section{Other Related Work}\label{sec:related}
\todo{The authors should compare their model to the thin-air solution of "Modular Relaxed Dependencies in Weak Memory Concurrency" from ESOP 2020.}

We survey related work not discussed in
\textsection\ref{sec:intro}-\ref{sec:logic} and \textsection\ref{sec:outro}.

A memory consistency model for a shared-memory multiprocessor defines the
values that a read may return.  For a survey of hardware models, see
\citep{AlglaveThesis}. For software models, see
\citep{DBLP:journals/toplas/Lochbihler13,DBLP:phd/ethos/Batty15}.  For an
attempt to bridge the two, see \citep{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/PodkopaevLV19}.

In our previous work~\cite{2019-sp}, we introduced the notion of pomsets with preconditions.
This was to study \emph{micro\hyp{}architecture}---specifically, speculative execution.
We have presented an \emph{architectural} model, leading to some formal
differences between the models.  Chief among these: we now require pomsets
to satisfy \emph{consistency} requirement, which simplifies the model,
though it can no longer reason about executions where speculative
behaviour can become visible, for example by cache timing attacks.
There are many less fundamental differences.  For example,
the previous use of \emph{three-valued pomsets} means that we allowed \ref{MCA2},
but disallowed its two-location variant.  This odd behavior stems from
\emph{semi\hyp{}transitivity}, inherited from
\cite{DBLP:journals/dc/Lamport86}.

True concurrency techniques have been applied to relaxed memory by
\citet{DBLP:conf/esop/CenciarelliKS07}, \citet{Castellan},
\citet{Pichon-Pharabod:2016:CSR:2837614.2837616}, and
\citet{DBLP:conf/cgo/ChakrabortyV17}.
% See
% \citet{DBLP:journals/lmcs/JeffreyR19} for a discussion.
Partial order models have been developed by \citet{brookes} and
\citet{DBLP:journals/lmcs/KavanaghB19}.

There is also a rich literature on the use of transformations over SC
executions to model relaxed memory:
%
\citet{Saraswat:2007:TMM:1229428.1229469}
aimed to describe a \jmm-like model this way.  \drfsc\ holds, but \citet{SP} 
discovered that it permits \oota\ behavior.
%
\citet{DBLP:conf/popl/DemangeLZJPV13} developed \textsc{bmm}, which permits
reordering of a relaxed write with a following relaxed read.
% The paper develops an axiomatic semantics and studies effects on compilation.  
\textsc{bmm} is designed as a restriction of the \jmm\ that compiles efficiently to
\tso.  It requires fencing on other architectures.

\citet{DBLP:conf/fm/LahavV16} characterized \tso\ as being derived by
considering Write-Read (\textsf{WR}) reordering and Read-After-Write
(\textsf{RAW}) elimination.  They also showed that the release acquires of
C11 are less expressive than considering \textsf{WR} and \textsf{RAW}
together with thread-inlining.  Our paper is inspired by their implicit
challenge: ``Some memory models can be defined via transformations.  But
there is more to weak memory than transformations.''

% \paragraph{Modeling the Invalidation of Load Buffering.} 

% In this paragraph, we argue that our paper is relevant even to the reader
% who desires a semantics that invalidates ``load buffering,'' or ``reads from the future.''
% There are two related lines of research that suggest to prohibit the
% reordering of loads with following stores.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \citet{Dolan:2018:BDR:3192366.3192421} imposed this restriction in
%   order to ``bound data races in space and time.''
%   Consider the following program:
%   % In the following program $r,s$ are registers, and $x,y,z,u,v,w$
%   % are shared variables.
%   % \begin{align*}

% In their model, one can deduce that $w$ must be assigned $1$, despite the

% % In their model, one can reason sequentially about the  assignment to $w$
% % and deduce that $x=1$ implies $z= 1$ despite the concurrent races on $u$, and
% % the past and future races on $y$, where past and future are stated with
% % respect to the assignment to $w$.

% \item In the C11 family of models, eg. see
%   \citep{Boehm:2014:OGA:2618128.2618134,DBLP:conf/pldi/LahavVKHD17,DBLP:conf/oopsla/VafeiadisN13},
%   load buffering is forbidden to avoid \oota. The elegant discussion in
%   \citet{BoehmOOTA} elucidates the issues via a series of ``\oota'' like
%   examples.  In particular, to rule out example~\ref{rfub}.
% \end{itemize}

% Our model can easily capture models that forbid load buffering.  It
% necessitates two changes.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Modify the semantic rule for read to remove the possibility of an
%   internal read:
%   \begin{align*}
%     \sem{\aReg\GETS\REF{\cExp}\SEMI \aCmd} & =
%     \textstyle\bigcup_{\aLoc=\REF{\bVal}}\; ({\cExp}=\bVal) \guard \textstyle\bigcup_\aVal\; (\DR\aLoc\aVal) \prefix \sem{\aCmd}[\aLoc/\aReg] 
%   \end{align*}
% \item Modify item \ref{pre-read}b in the definition of prefixing to require
%   order from a read to subsequent write.  Item \ref{pre-read}b$'$ becomes: if
%   $\aEv$ is a write then $\cEv\lt'\aEv$.  In \ref{pre-read}b$'$ we removed
%   the ``or  $\labelingForm'(\aEv)$ implies $\labelingForm(\aEv)$.''
% \end{itemize}

% While \citet{Dolan:2018:BDR:3192366.3192421} already describes DRF and the
% compilation to \armeight, our approach yields the following new insights.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Compositional treatment of temporal invariants
%   from \textsection\ref{sec:logic} holds mutatis mutandis, since all
%   executions of the restricted model are already accounted for in the general
%   model.

% \item With regards to single-threaded optimizations in
%   \textsection\ref{sec:opt}, our approach provides different methods to prove
%   optimizations, which complement the extant methods of
%   \citet{Dolan:2018:BDR:3192366.3192421} with data sensitivity; for example,
%   our methods provides a simple proof of the transformation of
%   $\IF{\aExp}\THEN x \GETS 1 \SEMI \aCmd \ELSE x\GETS 1 \SEMI \bCmd\FI$ to
%   $x \GETS 1 \SEMI \IF{\aExp}\THEN \aCmd \ELSE \bCmd\FI$.

\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limits}

\todo{assume fixed sized access}

Our work has several limitations, each of which provides an opportunity for
future research.  In several cases, these limitations have allowed us to
\emph{surpass prior work in significant ways}.

The model does not provide read-read coherence (\ref{Co2}), even for address
dependencies (\ref{OOTA2}). This model of coherence does not correspond to
either Java or C++, and therefore is unfamiliar.  \emph{We consider this all
  upside.  C++ invalidates \ref{CSE} on relaxed access.  Java invalidates
  the local \drfsc{} theorem \cite{Dolan:2018:BDR:3192366.3192421}.}

\todo{The model does not include address or data dependencies between reads.
  Note that we cannot get java final field semantics without distinguishing
  address dependency from other things, or keeping thread ids in actions.
  ARM requires that we do not order writes that only have a control
  dependency or that are fulfilled by an external writes.}

Final fields example without address dependency:
r=new C; r.f=1; Fence1; x=r   ||   s1=x; Fence2; if (s1) {s2=s1.f}
r=100; [r]=1; Fence1; x=r     ||   s1=x; Fence2; if (s1) {s2=[s1]}
without Fence2 we allow the outcome s1=100, s2=0

We treat loops via unrolling: loops introduce
complexities\allowbreak{}---such as liveness and continuity---that are
orthogonal to the main topic of the paper. We also do not include types,
allocation, garbage collection, etc.  This is the norm for work on relaxed
memory: The problem is already hard enough. \emph{On the upside, we do allow
  thread creation via $\!\!\PAR\!\!$, which is unusual.}

Except for roach motel (\ref{RelW}, \ref{AcqW}), the model does not validate
transformations that involve synchronizations and fences
\cite{DBLP:conf/popl/VafeiadisBCMN15}.  For example, the model does not
support elimination of redundant synchronization accesses.  Accommodating
such optimizations will likely require changes to the definition of
$\textsf{cover}$ (page \pageref{def:cover}) and $\textsf{read}$ (page
\pageref{page:readsat}).  \emph{On the upside, 
  Corollary~\ref{seqcompleteness} is the first abstract characterization of
  valid transformations for relaxed access.}

Our model realizes \emph{multi-copy atomicity} (\mca).  Thus it will not
compile efficiently to non-\mca{} architectures, such as \ppc\ and \armseven.
To do so, one cannot include the order required by the last item of
Definition~\ref{def:rf} in pomset order.  It may be sufficient to use a
weaker second order.  \citet{2019-sp} attempted to define such a weaker
order, but their model is anomalous on \ref{MCA2}---as we discussed in
\textsection\ref{sec:related}.  \emph{On the upside, ours is the first
  language-level model of \mca{}.  The use of preconditions does not depend
  on \mca, so there is hope to extend our approach to dependency calculations
  to non-\mca{} architectures.}

Our \drfsc{} theorem does not address fences or \RMW{}s.  \emph{On the upside,
we have proven a \emph{local} \drfsc{} theorem, which is stronger
than the standard \drfsc{} result.}

\labeltext{The}{page:logic:limits} logic we presented in \textsection\ref{sec:logic} is only strong enough
to prove a few examples.  \citet{DBLP:conf/esop/SvendsenPDLV18} presented a
different a logic, capable of showing that the following program cannot write
2:
% Some \oota\ examples can be proven if we extend the
% logic with value quantification---we leave the details to future work.

The attempted execution is \emph{not} allowed by our semantics since there is no write
to fulfill $(\DR{y}{1})$.  Proving this requires the ability to reason about
values.

    \end{tikzinline}}
\end{gather*}
The attempted execution is \emph{not} allowed by our semantics, due to the
evident cycle.  Surprisingly, this outcome is allowed by the promising
semantics \cite{DBLP:conf/popl/KangHLVD17}.
\citeauthor{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/ChakrabortyV19} developed \weakestmo{} to
address this example.  Intuitively, it is not possible for the left thread to
read $3$ for $x$ when the right thread reads $2$.  Proving this may require a
logic with modalities to deal with intervening writes and coherence.
\emph{On the upside, our logic is powerful enough to show that our semantics
  disallows \oota{} executions of \ref{OOTA4} --- \weakestmo{} and the
  promising semantics both permit \oota{} executions of \ref{OOTA4} (see \textsection\ref{sec:promising}).}

Our results have not been formally verified, but only because we do not have
the resources to do it ourselves.  It is worth noting that the current
emphasis on formal verification has the unintended effect of making research
more conservative: Large libraries are built, and large institutions with
teams of graduate students build them.


\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:outro}

We have defined a relaxed memory model, using standard tools from mathematics,
and demonstrated that it satisfies the fundamental criterion for
software memory models, namely ``the memory model must strike a balance
between ease-of-use for programmers and implementation flexibility for system
designers.''
We have made two substantial contributions:

In \textsection\ref{sec:logic}, we proposed a cyclical proof rule for
parallel composition of temporal properties in the style of
\citet{Abadi:1993:CS:151646.151649}.  This provides an objectively
falsifiable alternative to the notion of \emph{out of thin air} (\oota)
execution, which has been famously difficult to prove or disprove
\cite{DBLP:conf/esop/BattyMNPS15,BoehmOOTA}.

In \textsection\ref{sec:opt}, we formalized a connection between Hoare
logic and the sequential fragment of our language, allowing us to make a
general statement about transformations.  Thus, we present a solution to a
problem that has been open since \citet{DBLP:conf/esop/CenciarelliKS07}
discovered reordering of independent statements is invalid in the JMM
\cite{Manson:2005:JMM:1047659.1040336}.

These contributions rest on a semantics that supports a simple, executable
prescription of \emph{essential dependencies}, calculated using logic and
manifest in pomset order.  This provides a
clear interface between the language user and the compiler writer, and a
clear bridge from the compiler writer to computer architecture.

We presented a denotational semantics using pomsets with preconditions.  The
model may also be expressible in the operational framework of
\citet{DBLP:conf/esop/FerreiraFS10}, which parameterizes a standard SC
operational semantics with respect to a set of program transformations.

\section{Conclusions}
We have defined a relaxed memory model, using standard tools from the
semantics and demonstrated that it satisfies the fundamental criterion for
software memory models, namely ``the memory model must strike a balance
between ease-of-use for programmers and implementation flexibility for system
designers.''

One key lesson we draw is that any software relaxed memory model should
support the cyclical composition proof rule of
\citet{Abadi:1993:CS:151646.151649} for temporal properties.  We posit that all
the benefits of \oota, such as typing guarantees, can be derived from this
principle. 

We conclude with a suggestion for the consideration of programming language
designers.  The semantics of a programming language should support a clear
and executable prescription of dependency in a program.  Such a specification
provides a nice interface between the language user and the compiler writer,
and a clear bridge from the compiler writer to architectures.

Our current paper is to be viewed as a step towards this goal.  We will
explore developing an executable specification based on these ideas in future
work.

\section{SCRAPS}

Some \oota\ examples can be proven if we extend the logic with value
quantification---we leave the details to future work.  Consider

$\DR{y}{1}$.  Closing $x$ and $y$ and using the last two conjuncts in the
invariant above:

From the first conjunct, we then derive

Other \oota\ examples may require that we extend the logic to deal with

\subsection{RFUB}
Let $\aCmd$ be the right thread in \ref{rfub}.
\begin{align*}
  \aCmd = r\GETS y\SEMI \IF{r \NOTEQ 1} \THEN z\GETS 1\SEMI r\GETS 1\FI  \SEMI x\GETS r 
\end{align*}
Then, $\hoare{\TRUE}{\aCmd}{x=1} $ and $\hoare{y \neq 1}{\bCmd}{z=1}$.  Thus, the traditional sequential semantics {\em does not} attribute any cause for the write of $1$ to $x$, as seen by the execution:
\begin{tikzdisplay}[node distance=1em]
 \event{ry}{\DR{y}{1}}{}
 \event{wx}{\DW{x}{1}}{right=of ry}
 \event{wa}{\DW{z}{1}}{below=of rx}
 \rf{ry}{wa}
\end{tikzdisplay}
Consider the
following, where all locations are initialized to $0$.  In \textsection\ref{sec:logic} we provide machinery to prove that \oota{} is
incapable of writing $1$.  The question is whether this should be possible
for \rfub, which changes \oota{} only to include a \emph{Register assignment
  From an Unexecuted Branch} \cite{BoehmOOTA}:?  
\begin{align*}
  \label{oota}  \tag{\textsc{oota}}
  y\GETS x
  \PAR&
  r\GETS y\SEMI
  x\GETS r
  \\
  \tag{\rfub1}
  \label{rfub}
  y\GETS x
  \PAR&
  r\GETS y\SEMI
  \IF{r \NOTEQ 1} \THEN z\GETS 1\SEMI r\GETS 1\FI  \SEMI x\GETS r 
\end{align*}
%and the following \emph{Out Of Thin Air} litmus test:
The change in the second
thread from \oota{} to \rfub{} is not a valid refinement under Hoare logic:
\rfub{} validates the triple $\hoare{\TRUE}{\aCmd}{x=1}$, but \oota{} does
not.  As a result, it is expected that \rfub{} may have additional behaviors.

The program writes $1$ to $x$ in both branches of the conditional.  Further,
the writes to $z$ and $x$ in the then-branch of the conditional are
independent.  Therefore, it is sensible for a compiler to hoist the write to
$x$ out of the conditional.  In our semantics, there is no dependency from
the read of $y$ to the write to $x$
The execution in question is:
\begin{displaymathsmall}
  \begin{tikzcenter}[node distance=1em]
    \event{a1}{\DR{x}{1}}{}
    \event{a2}{\DW{y}{1}}{right=of a1}
    \po{a1}{a2}
  \end{tikzcenter}
  \Bigm\|
  (\DR{y}{1})
  \prefix
  \left(
    \begin{tikzcenter}[node distance=.5em]
      \event{b1}{r\NOTEQ1\mid\DW{z}{1}}{}
      \event{b2}{\DW{x}{1}}{right=of b1}
    \end{tikzcenter}
    % \begin{tikzcenter}[node distance=.5em]
    %   \event{b1}{r\NOTEQ1\mid\DW{z}{1}}{}
    %   \event{b2}{r\NOTEQ1\mid\DW{x}{1}}{right=of b1}
    % \end{tikzcenter}
    % \biggm\|
    % \begin{tikzcenter}[node distance=1em]
    %   \event{c1}{r\EQ1\mid\DW{x}{1}}{}
    % \end{tikzcenter}
  \right)
\end{displaymathsmall}
With an internal read of $y$, we have:
\begin{displaymathsmall}
  \begin{tikzcenter}[node distance=1em]
    \event{a1}{\DR{x}{1}}{}
    \event{a2}{\DW{y}{1}}{right=of a1}
    \po{a1}{a2}
  \end{tikzcenter}
  \Bigm\|
    \begin{tikzcenter}[node distance=1em]
      \event{b1}{y\NOTEQ1\mid\DW{z}{1}}{}
      \event{b2}{\DW{x}{1}}{right=of b1}
    \end{tikzcenter}
\end{displaymathsmall}
but the precondition $y\NOTEQ1$ cannot be satisfied locally.
With an external read of $(\DR{y}{1})$, we can discharge the precondition, but in this
case, the predicate becomes $1\NOTEQ 1$. 
\begin{displaymathsmall}
  \begin{tikzcenter}[node distance=1em]
    \event{a1}{\DR{x}{1}}{}
    \event{a2}{\DW{y}{1}}{right=of a1}
    \po{a1}{a2}
  \end{tikzcenter}
  \Bigm\|  
    \begin{tikzcenter}[node distance=1em]
      \nonevent{b1}{1\NOTEQ1\mid\DW{z}{1}}{}
      \event{b2}{\DW{x}{1}}{right=of b1}
      \event{b0}{\DR{y}{1}}{left=of b1}
      \po{b0}{b1}
    \end{tikzcenter}
\end{displaymathsmall}
