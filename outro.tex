\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:outro}

Differences with \cite{2019-sp}:
\begin{itemize}
\item We only consider pomsets where $\lt$-greater elements have stronger
  preconditions (Definition~\ref{def:3pre}).
\item We only consider pomsets that are coherent (Definition~\ref{def:3pre}).
\item Prefixing only introduces required order from read to write in item~\ref{pre-implies} (Definition~\ref{def:prefix}).
\item We provide semantics for computed addresses of memory locations.
\item The semantics of relaxed read internal actions.
\item restriction introduces internal actions.
\item The semantics of parallel composition is asymmetric.  This ensures that
  in $\aCmd;(\bCmd_1\PAR\bCmd_2)$, $\bCmd_1$ may read internally from $\aCmd$,
  but all reads in $\bCmd_2$ must be explicit.
\end{itemize}
