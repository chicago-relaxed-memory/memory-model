We define a relaxed memory model for multi-copy atomic architectures.  The
model has simple mathematical foundations, using only two relations between
events.  We show that the model (1) satisfies the \drfsc\ criterion, (2)
compiles to \tso\ and \armeight\ without fences on relaxed operations, (3)
supports compiler optimizations, and (4) supports compositional reasoning
using temporal properties.
