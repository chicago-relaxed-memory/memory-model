A memory model, designed to be as weak as possible.
\begin{itemize}
\item Compilation result (compile to C++, or LLVM, or hardware models) without fences
\item Soundness of optimizations (list from LDRF paper + those from promising
  semantics)  Follow dolan.
\item DRF programs have SC semantics
\item satisfies JMM test cases and other examples
\item supports a program logic and no-TAR
\item is compositional
\end{itemize}  

Other things:
\begin{itemize}
\item Full abstraction:  If two programs are different, then there is a
  distinguishing context of the form P; [] || Q; R
\item precisely models dependency
\end{itemize}
