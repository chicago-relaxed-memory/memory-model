The fundamental problem in the study of relaxed memory is to simultaneously achieve efficient implementability and thread-compositional reasoning.  We define a model for C11-style concurrency that meets these goals, building on simple and traditional mathematical  foundations that are well understood at LICS.   We show that the model
(1) supports compositional reasoning for temporal safety properties,
(2) supports all reasonable sequential compiler optimizations, 
(3) satisfies the \drfsc\ criterion, and
(4) compiles to Intel and ARM microprocessors without requiring extra fences on relaxed operations.
