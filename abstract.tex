We define a relaxed memory model, building on simple and traditional mathematical foundations,  for multi-copy atomic architectures.  We show that the model (1) satisfies the \drfsc\ criterion, (2)
compiles to \tso\ and \armeight\ without fences on relaxed operations, (3)
supports all reasonable sequential compiler optimizations, and (4) supports compositional reasoning for temporal safety properties.
