The fundamental problem in the study of relaxed memory is to simultaneously achieve efficient implementability and thread-compositional reasoning.  We define such a relaxed memory model for C11, building on simple and traditional mathematical  foundations that are well understood at LICS.   We show that the model (1) satisfies the \drfsc\ criterion, (2)
compiles to Intel and ARM microprocessors %\mca\ hardware
without requiring extra fences on relaxed operations, (3)
supports all reasonable sequential compiler optimizations, and (4) supports compositional reasoning for temporal safety properties.
